            <p>
              I have lived most of my life in Boulder, CO and was taught to
              embrace adventure. Colorado is known for being an unpredictable
              environment as the weather and events that follow can change by
              the minute. Growing up in an ever-changing environment has taught
              me many things but the most important lesson was to be able to
              adapt. Initially, I had no desire to enter the world of tech and I
              refused to accept it’s increasing integration in our lives. Being
              young and growing up alongside the social media era, I had a
              narrow view on technology. I wanted people to socialize instead of
              tweet, to call instead of text, and for people to eat their food
              without taking another #mylunch photo. That’s exactly where I was
              wrong, software is so much larger than just media. Adaptation
              doesn't always have to be an alteration of your person or the
              thing itself, but it can also be a change in perspective. Once my
              perspective changed, I saw just how many opportunities there were
              to personally or indirectly create positive change in the world
              through software development. Software could be and often is
              developed for hospitals, research facilities, prosthetics and
              environmental needs. The applications are limitless. While I've
              just begun my adventure into software development, I can say I am
              extremely proud to be a part of this field. Feel free to browse my
              work and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions/comments!
